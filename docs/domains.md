# Domain Map

Where the Coralia Sequence applies — organized by validation status.

## Validated

| Domain | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Sleep Architecture | 99.2-99.4 percentile |
| Heart Rate Variability | Cardiac rhythm patterns |
| Music Theory | Structural correspondence |

## Origin (Physics)

These domains are where the framework came from.

| Domain | Connection |
|--------|------------|
| Planetary Resonance | Kirkwood gaps, orbital mechanics |
| Angle of Repose | 3 tipping points discovery |
| Crystallography | φ-based quasicrystal structures |
| Quantum Physics | Energy level spacing (cobalt niobate) |

## Testable

| Domain | What to test |
|--------|--------------|
| Neural Firing Patterns | Theta-gamma coupling, brainwave phase |
| Circadian Substructure | Ultradian rhythms, hormone timing |
| Linguistics | Sentence length, Zipf extensions |
| Population Ecology | Species oscillations, predator-prey |
| Urban Growth | City expansion phases |
| Visual Aesthetics | Proportion systems |
| Dance/Movement | Choreography phrasing |
| Film/Narrative | Scene lengths, plot timing |
| Network Architecture | Node spacing, packet timing |
| Algorithm Design | Checkpoint scheduling |
| Compression | Block size optimization |
| Learning/Skill | Spaced repetition |

## Key Properties

C applies best to systems with:
- Discrete state transitions (not continuous flow)
- Bounded structure (ceiling and floor)
- Multi-scale behavior (zones with different patterns)
- Tipping points / regime changes

## The 43% Cliff

Position 15/35 = 3/7 is where cascade begins.

Look for this in systems that show sudden regime changes.
