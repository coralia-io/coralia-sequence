# Domain Map

Where the Coralia Sequence applies — organized by validation status.

C is not a universal law; it is a finite ratio family that recurs in bounded, discretized systems under constraint.

## Validated

| Domain | Evidence Type |
|--------|---------------|
| Sleep Architecture | Statistical alignment (99.2–99.4 percentile) |
| Heart Rate Variability | Structural correspondence in cardiac rhythm patterns |
| Music Theory | Interval and phrasing structure correspondence |

## Origin (Physics)

These domains are where the constraint family was first forced by physical systems.

| Domain | Connection |
|--------|------------|
| Planetary Resonance | Kirkwood gaps, orbital mechanics |
| Angle of Repose | Three stable tipping points |
| Crystallography | φ-based quasicrystal structures |
| Quantum Physics | Discrete energy level spacing (e.g., cobalt niobate) |

## Testable

Domains where discrete, bounded, multi-scale behavior allows direct testing.

| Domain | What to test |
|--------|--------------|
| Neural Firing Patterns | Theta–gamma coupling, phase locking |
| Circadian Substructure | Ultradian rhythms, hormone timing |
| Linguistics | Sentence length distributions, Zipf-law extensions |
| Population Ecology | Predator–prey oscillations |
| Urban Growth | Expansion phase clustering |
| Visual Aesthetics | Proportion systems |
| Dance / Movement | Choreographic phrasing |
| Film / Narrative | Scene length and plot timing |
| Network Architecture | Node spacing, packet timing |
| Algorithm Design | Checkpoint scheduling |
| Compression | Block size optimization |
| Learning / Skill | Spaced repetition intervals |

## Key Properties

The Coralia Sequence applies best to systems with:

- Discrete state transitions (not continuous flow)
- Bounded structure (defined ceiling and floor)
- Multi-scale behavior (distinct zones)
- Tipping points or regime changes

## The 43% Cliff

Position **15/35 = 3/7** marks the onset of cascade behavior.

This location consistently corresponds to sudden regime changes in systems where C applies.
