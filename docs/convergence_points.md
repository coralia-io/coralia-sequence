# Convergence Points

Systems have 3 tipping points, not 1.

## The Three Λs

| Point | Value | Position | Role |
|-------|-------|----------|------|
| Λ₁ | 6.25 | Between C[4]=5 and C[5]=7 | Zone 1→2 transition |
| Λ₂ | φ⁶ ≈ 17.944 | Between C[8]=15 and C[9]=23 | 43% cliff — cascade begins |
| Λ₃ | Q₀ ≈ 21.246 | Between C[8]=15 and C[9]=23 | Shadow/universal threshold |

## Origin

All three derive from φ³ ≈ 4.236.

This discovery came from **physics** — specifically the angle of repose in granular materials, and Kirkwood gaps in orbital mechanics.

## The 43% Cliff

Position 15/35 = 3/7 ≈ 0.43

This is where systems show sudden regime changes:
- Phase transitions
- Cascade failures
- Tipping points

## Bidirectional Boundaries

The convergence points form both ceiling AND floor — they constrain in both directions.

## Where They Apply

Any system with:
- Discrete state transitions
- Bounded structure (has limits)
- Multi-scale behavior
- Regime changes
